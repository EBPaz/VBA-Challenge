# VBA-Challenge
Module 2 Challenge - VBA

For my VBA Challenge homework I did recieve help from tutor, Jesse Wright. He helped me think through my formatting
to get my code applied to every sheet. He did not tell me the answer to activate the worksheets, but helped me process 
the reasoning to get there.

Regarding my if loops for percent change, color formatting and total volume, I was given feedback from 3 separate Learning
Assistants. Vinny, Deborah and Bigyan. They helped me reference my code with aligned examples. Deborah helped me the most
by processing coding theory and how the computer is thinking about my code. 

For the Greatest % Increase and Decrease, I referenced this website: https://www.educba.com/vba-max/ 
However, it did not help me fully complete that part of the assignment as I could not interpret using their examples
within my code very well.
