Module 2 Challenge - VBA

My homework has presented an unexpected barrage of learning skills. I have attached the screen shots for the alphabetizing stocks
file of our homework. I am aware that was not the submission you requested, however, the main stock data keeps crashing my Excel 
program on every attempt. I submit this as a means to show as much of my work as possible. I will re-attempt to run my code on the 
main stock data again tomorrow. Thank you for your consideration of this homework in advance.


For my VBA Challenge homework I did recieve help from tutor, Jesse Wright. He helped me think through my formatting
to get my code applied to every sheet. He did not tell me the answer to activate the worksheets, but helped me process 
the reasoning to get there.

Regarding my if loops for percent change, color formatting and total volume, I was given feedback from 3 separate Learning
Assistants. Vinny, Deborah and Bigyan. They helped me reference my code with aligned examples. Deborah helped me the most
by processing coding theory and how the computer is thinking about my code. 

For the Greatest % Increase and Decrease, I referenced this website: https://www.educba.com/vba-max/ 
However, it did not help me fully complete that part of the assignment as I could not interpret using their examples
within my code very well.
